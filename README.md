AI Personal Assistant

Overview

This project implements a personalized AI assistant built in Google Colab during the Inspirit AI Scholars Program. The project focuses on turning a problem idea into a working AI prototype.

Project goal

• Build a functional AI assistant with personalized responses.
• Apply machine learning concepts in a real project.
• Move from concept to prototype using Python.

Tools and environment

• Python.
• Google Colab.
• Libraries and APIs used during the program.

How the system works

• The user enters text input.
• The system processes the input using defined logic or models.
• The assistant generates a response based on the processed input.

Key features

• Personalized responses based on user input.
• Clear project structure inside a single notebook.
• End to end workflow from idea to output.

What I learned

• How to structure an AI project.
• How to build and test models in Google Colab.
• How to evaluate outputs and iterate on design.
