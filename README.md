AI Personal Assistant

Overview

This project implements a personalized AI assistant built in Google Colab during the Inspirit AI Scholars Program. The focus is on translating a problem idea into a working AI prototype and documenting the design process.

Project goal

• Build a functional AI assistant with personalized responses
• Apply machine learning and prompt design concepts in a real project
• Move from concept to prototype using Python

Tools and environment

• Python
• Google Colab
• Program provided libraries and APIs

How the system works

• The user enters text input
• The system processes the input using defined logic and prompts
• The assistant generates a response based on the processed input

Key features

• Personalized responses driven by prompt design
• Clear project structure within a single notebook
• End to end workflow from idea to output

What I learned

• How to structure an AI project from problem definition to prototype
• How to experiment with assistant behavior and safety constraints
• How to evaluate outputs and iterate on system design

Limitations

• External API access is disabled outside the program environment
• The notebook represents a prototype focused on design and logic rather than deployment

Program context

This project was completed as part of the Inspirit AI Scholars Program. Selected as a top performing high school student leader
